# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Description
The application did not properly encode user input, allowing JavaScript code to be injected into the feedback form and executed in users' browsers.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the "Contact Us" or Feedback page.
2. In the comment field, enter: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
3. Submit the form.
4. Observe the JavaScript alert popup when the comment is rendered.

## Risk Level: High
XSS can lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, and the execution of malicious scripts in the browser of unsuspecting users.

## Mitigation
- Sanitize and encode all user-supplied input.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Use libraries that auto-escape HTML

  ## Summary
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the feedback submission form of the OWASP Juice Shop application.
