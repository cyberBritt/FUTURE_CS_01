# Missing Content Security Policy Header

## Description
The application does not include a `Content-Security-Policy` header in HTTP responses.  
Without this header, browsers cannot enforce restrictions on resource loading, making it easier for attackers to exploit XSS and other injection attacks.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run OWASP ZAP passive scan against `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Review the HTTP response headers for any page.
3. Notice the absence of a `Content-Security-Policy` header.

## Risk Level: Medium
Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the site, and browsers will execute them without restriction.

## Mitigation
- Implement a CSP header to restrict resource loading to trusted sources.
