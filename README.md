# Web Application Security Testing

## Project Overview
This task involved conducting vulnerability assessments on a deliberately vulnerable web application using OWASP. The goal was to identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities mitigation steps and risk levels.

## Skills Gained
- Web application vulnerability scanning  
- Security documentation and reporting  
- Knowledge of OWASP Top 10 threats  
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing  
- Threat modeling and risk analysis  

##  Tools Used
- **OWASP ZAP** â€“ Open-source web app scanner  
- **Burp Suite** â€“ Manual testing toolkit  
- **SQLMap** â€“ SQL injection automation tool  
- **OWASP Juice Shop** â€“ Vulnerable test app  
- **Kali Linux** â€“ Security testing OS  
- **Google Docs, PDF** â€“ Final report creation  

## Deliverables
- âœ… Security Assessment Report (PDF)  
- âœ… Screenshots of findings and attack vectors  
- âœ… OWASP Top 10 Checklist mapping  
- âœ… Mitigation recommendations  
- âœ… Tool logs (ZAP, Burp issues, etc.)

## Vulnerabilities Found

- **SQL Injection** â€“ Database manipulation via malicious input in login fields.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** â€“ Script injection in input fields resulting in client-side code execution.
- **Authentication Bypass** â€“ Unauthorized access to admin account through brute-force attack.
- **Missing CSP Header** â€“ Increased risk of XSS attacks due to absent Content Security Policy (CSP).

## ðŸ§¾ Final Outcome

This assessment demonstrated how common web application flaws can be exploited and visualized using industry tools. Key takeaways:

- **3â€“5 real vulnerabilities** were successfully discovered.
- Issues were mapped against the **OWASP Top 10**, with explanations and fixes.
- The findings were compiled into a **professional-grade Security Assessment Report** with risk ratings and mitigation strategies.

The completed project simulates real-world penetration testing and is suitable for use in a cybersecurity portfolio or during interviews.
