# Authentication Bypass

## Description
The login mechanism allowed access without validating the correct password, enabling attackers to log in using known usernames or weak credentials.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Intercept a login request using Burp Suite Intruder.
2. Modify the request body to bypass validation logic, or try common usernames with blank or default passwords.
3. Forward the request.
4. Observe successful login without proper credentials.

## Payloads Used
  - admin: admin
  - admin: letmein
  - admin: 123456
  - admin: juice123
  - admin: OR 1=1

## Risk
High
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts through automated credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.

## Mitigation
- Enforce strong password validation.
- Rate-limit login attempts.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Log and monitor login anomalies.
