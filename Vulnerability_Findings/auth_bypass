## Weak Authentication Mechanism / Brute Force Vulnerability

- **Endpoint**: /rest/user/login
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: The application does not implement protections against brute-force login attempts. Using Burp Suite Intruder, multiple login attempts were made with weak and commonly used passwords without triggering any account lockout or rate limiting mechanisms.
- **Payloads Used**:
  - admin: admin
  - admin: letmein
  - admin: 123456
  - admin: juice123
  - admin: OR 1=1
- **Risk**: High
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts through automated credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
  - Add account lockout or CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts.
  - Enforce strong password policies.
