# SQL Injection

## Description
The login form failed to properly sanitize user input, allowing raw SQL queries to be executed directly against the database.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the login page.
2. In the username field, enter: `' OR 1=1--`
3. Leave the password field blank or enter any text.
4. Submit the form and observe successful login without valid credentials.

## Impact
An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user or admin accounts, potentially leading to data breaches.

## Mitigation
- Implement parameterized queries (prepared statements).
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Use ORM frameworks where possible.
